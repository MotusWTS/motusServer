# The motusServer status API #

This API provides access to information about the motus data processing
server, jobs, and errors.  It also permits some server-side tasks to
be executed (job retry, server restart, processing of new uploaded file, ...)

## API summary ##

### Request ###
 - requests are sent by the HTTP POST method
 - the request has header `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
 - can have an optional header `Accept-Encoding: gzip` in which case the reply
   will be gzip-compressed, rather then bzip2-compressed (see below)
 - the POST data has a single item called `json`, which is a JSON-encoded object.
 - the fields of `json` are the parameters listed for each API entrypoint below.
 - most requests require an `authToken` value, which can be obtained by a call
   to `authenticate_user`; alternatively, it can be the value (*not* URL-encoded) of a cookie
   named `auth_tkt` which is generated by the server's [main login page](https://sgdata.motus.org/login.php)
   according to the Apache mod-auth-tkt module.  Code for generating the cookie can
   be seen in [R](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motusServer/blob/new_server/R/validate_request.R)
   or in [PHP](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motusServer/blob/new_server/inst/scripts/www/login.php)
 - if a request indicates that a parameter should be an array, then
   a scalar of the same type can be provided instead, and is treated as an array of length 1.
   i.e. the API doesn't distinguish between `"par":X` and `"par":[X]` if `X` is a double, integer,
   boolean or string

### Reply ###
 - is a JSON-encoded object: header `Content-Type = application/json`
 - is bzip2-compressed: header `Content-Encoding = bzip2`.  To support browsers and other
   contexts without native bzip2 decompression, if the request had a
   header called `Accept-Encoding` that includes the string "gzip", then the
   reply is gzip-compressed, with header `Content-Encoding: gzip`.
 - most returned objects have fields which are arrays of
   equal length, which is the natural JSON encoding of an R data.frame
 - errors are indicated by including a field called `error` in the reply; other
   fields might be present, giving additional information.  If no field `error`
   is present, the request succeeded.
 - requests return a (fixed) maximum number of rows.  If a reply has
   fewer than the maximum number of rows, there are no further data
   for the given query; i.e. the next `paging` call to the same API
   would return 0 rows.  The maximum number of rows can be obtained by
   calling `api_info`

Examples are given for each call using the command-line
client [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) with quoting
appropriate for the Bash shell.  These examples return the raw
bzip2-compressed data. To view the response, redirect the output of
curl into a file and use [7zip](http://7-zip.org) to decompress it
(for example), or add ` | bunzip2 -cd ` to the end of the command in
Bash.

The server is at [https://sgdata.motus.org](https://sgdata.motus.org) and the URL prefix is "/status".

## API calls ##

### status_api info ###

   status_api_info (authToken)

      e.g.
      curl https://sgdata.motus.org/status2/status_api_info

   - return a list with these items:

      - maxRows: integer, maximum number of rows returned by a query

      - uploadPath: character, path to upload folder relative to top-level of NAS storage;
        the `path` of an uploaded file passed in a call to `process_new_upload` API must be
        relative to `uploadPath`; e.g. if `uploadPath` is `sgdata/sgm/uploads`, and if the
        `process_new_upload` API is called with `path`=`user232/2017-03-15/newfiles.zip`,
        the uploaded file must be at `NAS:/sgdata/sgm/uploads/user232/2017-03-15/newfiles.zip`


### authenticate user ###

   authenticate_user (user, password)

      - user: username
      - password: password (in cleartext)

      e.g.
      curl --data-urlencode json='{"user":"someone","password":"bigsecret"}' https://sgdata.motus.org/status2/authenticate_user

   - returns a list with these items:
      - authToken: string; 264 random bits, base64-encoded
      - expiry: double; timestamp of expiry for token
      - userID: integer; motus ID for user
      - projects: integer array; of project #s user is allowed to request tag detections for
      - receivers: string array of serial #s of receivers user is allowed to request tag detections for

   or

   - a list with this item:
      - error: "authentication with motus failed"

### Notes ###

1. The `authToken` returned by this API must be included in most other
API calls (for an alternative, see 2.)

2.  Instead of obtaining the token from this API entry, you can use
the non-URL-encoded value of the cookie called `auth_tkt`, obtained by
logging in via
the [main login page](https://sgdata.motus.org/login.php).  The
non-URL-encoded value of the `auth_tkt` cookie can be used as
`authToken`, which avoids having to call `authenticate_user` if the
user has already logged in.  To use `auth_tkt`, the IP address from
which the login occurred must be passed as a dotted-quad string in the
header field `X-Forwarded-For` to any of the requests in this API,
along with passing the cookie value in the JSON field `authToken`.

The correct `X-Forwarded-For` header is generated automatically if the status
API is accessed  from
client-side javascript.  However, if the URL is accessed from a PHP
script on a server, the automatically-generated IP address for the
header will be that of the server running the PHP script, rather than
of the ultimate client, which is wrong.  So to call this API from
a server-side script, you need to specify the `X-Forwarded-For`
header explicitly, in which case no value will be generated automatically.
Here's an example in php:

``` php
/// @param $url: full URL of API entry
/// @param $par: associative array of API parameters

function post ($url, $par) {
    $ch = curl_init($url);
    $par['authToken'] = $_COOKIE['auth_tkt'];
    $json = 'json=' . urlencode(json_encode($par));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
                                               'X-Forwarded-For: ' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,  $json);
    $res = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    return(json_decode(bzdecompress($res), true));
}
```

3. Authorization is by project: if a user has permission for a
project, then that user can see:

   - status of all jobs submitted for that project

If an API call does not find any information for which the user is
authorized, it will return a json object of the usual structure,
except that column arrays will have length zero.  This represents an R
data.frame with the correct column names but zero rows.

The API doesn't currently provide a way to tell whether there are additional data
which would be returned for a given call if the user had authorization for more
projects.


### list_jobs ###

   list_jobs (projectID, select, order, options, authToken)

       - projectID: integer; motus projectID (s); jobs must belong to the given project(s)
       - select: object with fields for selecting which jobs to list.  A job must match all
         fields provided in order to be included in the list.  Fields are:
          - userID: integer; motus user ID
          - stump: ID of top level job; select only from that job and its descendents
          - jobID: integer array;; to select only those jobs specified
          - type: string array; the job type(s)
          - done: integer; 0: job not yet complete; 1: job completed successfully; -1: job had error
          - log: string; job whose log matches the string `log`, which can include globbing
            characters ('*' and '.')
       - order: object with fields for ordering and paging the selected jobs:
      - sortBy: string scalar; null, or the sort key, i.e. one of these string constants, each of which
        can be optionally followed by the string constant 'desc' for descending order
         - "ctime", "ctime desc": job creation time
         - "mtime", "mtime desc": last job activity time
         - "id", "id desc": job ID number
         - "type", "type desc": job type
         - "motusProjectID", "motusProjectID desc": motus project ID
         - "motusUserID", "motusUserID desc": motus user ID
        If `sortBy` is not specified, it is set to `"mtime desc"`. To allow paging, an implicity "id" is
        added to sortBy if it is not already there, with a "desc" if `sortBy` has it.
          - lastKey: optional; vector giving "last" obtained value of the field specified in `sortBy`; an optional
            second element gives the "last" obtained value of the "id", if `sortBy` is not "id".  This is
            used for paging.  If not specified, returns the first page according to `sortBy` criteria.
          - forwardFromKey: boolean; default: true.  If `lastKey` is specified and this field is true,
            return a page of items past the key in the forward (sort) direction.  Otherwise, if this field is false,
            return a page of items past the key in the backward (reverse sort) direction.
       - options: object with fields giving options:
          - includeUnknownProjects: include jobs with no associated motus project; typically for
            jobs initiated by staff or otherwise not having a useful concept of project
          - includeSubjobs: logical: include jobs which are not top-level jobs?; default FALSE
          - full: if `true`, then full details for the job (typically its parameters, log, summary, and list of
            product files) are returned in a JSON-formatted column called `data`
          - countOnly: boolean; if true, return only a count of jobs for the given projectID and/or userID
          - limit: integer; if present, maximum number of records to return.

      e.g.
      curl --data-urlencode json='{"select":{"userno":232},"order":{"sortBy":"id","lastKey":[5000]},"authToken":"XXX"}' https://sgdata.motus.org/status2/list_jobs

   - return a list of jobs; unless includeSubjobs is true, return only top-level jobs.
     A top level job has one of these types:
     - 'uploadFiles': process a batch of receiver files uploaded by user
     - 'syncReceiver': poll an online receiver for new data and process them
     - 'serverFiles': process a batch of files manually copied to server
     - 'rerunReceiver': rerun the tag finder on existing data files
     Top-level jobs generate sub jobs; e.g. `uploadFiles` will typically generate one or more
     tag finder jobs of types `LtFindtags` or `SGfindtags`, a data summary job of type `plotData`,
     and a data merging job of type `exportData`.

     Only jobs to which the user has permission are returned.

   - if `countOnly` is `false`, fields in the returned object are these arrays:
      - `id`: integer array; job ids
      - `pid`: integer array; parent job ids
      - `stump`: integer array; top-level job ids
      - `ctime`: double array; creation times (unix timestamp; seconds since 1 Jan 1970 GMT)
      - `mtime`: double array; modification time (unix timestamp; seconds since 1 Jan 1970 GMT)
      - `type`: string array; type of job; e.g. "uploadFile"
      - `done`: integer array; 0 if not yet run; +1 if successful; < 0 if error
      - `queue`: integer array; number of queue job is in; 0 means waiting
      - `path`: string array; file system path to job folder, if any
      - `motusUserID`: integer array; motus user ID of person who submitted job
      - `motusProjectID`: integer array; project ID for results of job
      - `data`: (if `full` was `true` in the request) string array; json-encoded job parameters, log, summary, products
      - `sjDone`: (if `includeSubjobs` is not `true` in the request) integer array; minimum `done` value for all subjobs
         of the top-level job, including that of the top-level job itself.  So: 0, if all subjobs are either not yet done
         or completed without error; < 0 if at least one subjob had an error; +1 if all subjobs completed successfully

### process new upload ###

   process_new_upload (userID, projectID, path, ts, authToken)

      - userID: integer scalar; motus user ID (who uploaded the file)
      - projectID; integer scalar; motus projectID (what project should own the products; as chosen by upload user)
      - path; string scalar; path to the new file on the NAS, relative to the value of `uploadPath` returned by the `status_api_info` API.
        e.g. if `path` is given as '123/2017-10-20T11-12-33_upload.zip`, then
        on linux, we'll expect to find the file at `nfs://174.140.177.35:/volume1/sgdata/sgm/uploads/123/2017-10-20T11-12-33_upload.zip`
        which will have actual path /sgm/uploads/123/2017-10-20T11-12-33_upload.zip, given the current NAS mountpoints.
        path` must not include any '..' component; i.e. ascent up the file tree is not permitted, to prevent malicious use
        from leaking system information.
        Both forward (`/`) and reverse (`\`) slashes are interpreted as folder delimiters.
      - ts; double; timestamp (seconds since 1 Jan 1970, GMT); time at which file upload completed.  If not supplied, the current
        time is used.

   - return: an object with these items:
      - `jobID`: the integer motus ID for the new job
      - `uploadID`: the integer motus ID for the upload

   **Recommended format for file paths:**
   We want file paths:
    - encoded in UTF-8
    - to provide intrinsic collision avoidance
    - identify the user who uploaded them

   So, a file path should look like this:

```
      XXX/123/123_2017-10-20T15-21-35_user_name_for_file.zip
```
   where:

   - `XXX/` component is an optional prefix path, in case the upload tree isn't rooted at `uploadPath` (see above).
   - `123` is the userID of the upload user; it is included twice: once as a folder, and once in the filename
     to protect against inadvertent mis-filing; in the filename, it is followed by an underscore (`_`)
   - `2017-10-20T15-21-35` is the timetamp of the upload; in the filename, it is followed by an underscore (`_`)
   - `user_name_for_file.zip` is the full user-supplied filename, in UTF-8; it must not include any forward slash
      (`/`) characters; we also forbid double-quote (`"`) characters, to simplify handling.

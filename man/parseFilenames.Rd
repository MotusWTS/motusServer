\usage{
parseFilenames(f, base = basename(f))
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{character vector of filenames with full path}

\item{base}{character vector of file basenames; these default to
\code{basename(f)}, but will differ when the basename has been
corrected (e.g. to remove invalid UTF-8 sequences).}
}
\value{
a dataframe of components, with one row per filename and these columns:

\enumerate{
 \item "prefix":  human readable short site name
 \item "serno":  receiver serial number; "SG-" followed by 12 alphanumeric characters e.g. 1315BBBK2156, or possibly with an appended "_N" where N is 1, 2, ...
 for disentangling serial number collisions.
 \item "bootnum":  boot count (integer)
 \item "ts":  timestamp embedded in name (double, with class \code{c("POSIXt", "POSIXct")} )
 \item "tsCode":  timestamp code ('P' means before GPS fix, 'Z' means accurate to 1e-6 s, 'Y' to 1e-5s, 'X' to 1e-4s, ..., 'T' to 1s)
 \item "port":  port number, if this file is associated with a single port (e.g. a .WAV file); NA if all ports
 \item "extension":  extension of uncompressed file; e.g. ".txt"
 \item "comp":  integer; file compression type":  NA = uncompressed, 1 = gzip, 2 = lzip

}
}
\description{
parse sensorgnome filenames into components
}
\note{
Returns NULL if no filenames match regex; otherwise, return value has rows
filled with NA for any filenames not matching the expected form

To resolve the collision between the CTRiver/Sugarloaf and Motus/PointLepreau receivers which
both have serial number 1614BBBK1911, we give Sugarloaf an additional "_1".  This change is also
effected by renaming the files on disk.

\title{Call an external program safely, return its output and
propagate any error into R.}
\usage{
safeSys(cmd, ..., shell = TRUE, quote = TRUE, minErrorCode = 1,
  splitOutput = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmd}{full path to the executable file (can be a shell script,
for example)}

\item{...}{list of un-named parameters to the command; if
\code{shell == TRUE}, these are quoted as appropriate for
bash-type shell.  Otherwise, they are passed as-is.
Note that any args consisting of a single semicolon (';') will
not be quoted, since they are presumably intended to delimit
commands.}

\item{shell}{logical scalar; if TRUE, invoke command using a shell;
otherwise, invoke cmd directly.}

\item{quote}{logical scalar; if TRUE (the default) and if
\code{shell == TRUE}, quote individual arguments for the shell}

\item{minErrorCode}{the smallest integer return value that
indicates an error.  Some programs (e.g. 'grep') violate the
usual convention that 0 = no error, and > 0 indicates an error.
Default: 1}

\item{splitOutput}{logical; if TRUE, output is returned as a vector
with one item per line.  Otherwise, the default, output is
returned as a character scalar with embedded newlines.}
}
\value{
character vector of the stdout stream from running
    \code{cmd}, as one long item.  This will have attribute "exitCode"
    giving the exit code of the command, which will be in the range
    \code{0: (minErrorCode - 1)}
}
\description{
This function provides the sole access point to external programs
for this package.
}
\details{
If the exit status of the command is non-zero, then this function
triggers an error using \code{stop(E)} where the message \code{E}
will be a character scalar consisting of the lines written to
stderr by the command, pasted together with "\\n".

Otherwise, this function returns a character scalar with liens
written to stdout by the command, pasted together with "\\n".

The point of internalizing errors is so that we save the
intermediate files and record a full stack dump.  Otherwise, the
server might delete downloaded files, thinking (incorrectly) that
it has processed them successfully.
}
\note{
stdout and stderr for the command are redirected to temporary
    files which are deleted before this function returns.

# motusServer

R package to operate a server to process data for http://motus.org

**Motus users**: you don't want this package.  You want
the "motus" package available here:  https://github.com/jbrzusto/motus

This package processes raw data from receivers and stores results in
a master database which can be accessed via the [motus client package](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motusClient)

#' watch for and enqueue uploaded files
#'
#' Watch for new files in \code{MOTUS_PATH$UPLOADS};
#' and when a new file is found, queue a job to process it.
#'
#' @param tracing logical scalar, default FALSE.  If TRUE, enter
#'     debug browser before handling each new file upload.
#'
#' @param fileEvent character scalar; default: "CREATE".  The
#' last filesystem event generated by the external program which
#' is placing files in the \code{MOTUS_PATH$UPLOADS} folder.
#' For other upload systems, the appropriate event might be "CLOSE_WRITE"
#' or "MOVED_TO".  The event should only occur once per uploaded file
#' and only after the full file contents are available.
#'
#' @return This function does not return; it is meant for use in an R
#'     script run in the background.  After each subjob is handled,
#'     the function checks for the existence of a file called
#'     \code{MOTUS_PATH$INBOX/killE}.  If that file is found,
#'     the function calls quit(save="no").  The file will also
#'     be detected within the call to feed() when the queue
#'     is empty, because it is located in the watched folder.
#'
#' @note this depends on some other process placing uploaded files into
#' the folder \code{MOTUS_PATH$UPLOADS}.  We're using a patched version of
#' \link{http://www.projectsend.org}
#' whose last task for an uploaded file is to create a hardlink to it
#' in \code{MOTUS_PATH$UPLOADS}, and this generates a "CREATE" event.
